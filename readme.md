# (Ford GoBike System Dataset Exploration)
## By (Mariam  Ahmad Alghamdi)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

> The number of men interested in driving bicycles is three times the number of women.
> The ages of most of the bikers are between 20 and 40 years old.
> On Sunday and Monday are the lowest rounds numbers, Wednesday and Thursday are the most days
> The peak hours are eight in the morning and five in the evening.
> The effect of the days on cyclists of both genders is close and relevant.
> With regard to peak times, it appears that the number of women at eight in the morning is more than five in the afternoon by a slight difference, while for men the number of them at five in the afternoon is slightly greater than what it is at eight in the morning.
> Bicycle riders between the ages of 25-40 are ride the longest times compared to the rest of them.
> The rush hours for the Subscriber user type are 8:00 am and 5:00 pm , For Customer user type is 5:00 pm.
> The average minutes duration for men and women, whether they are Subscriber or Customer user type is almost 10 minutes.
> The average age for men and women, whether they are Subscriber or Customer user type is almost 39 .
> The number of women Subscriber user type is greater than the number of women of Customer user type.
> The peak days for women of Customer user type are in SAT and SUN and for women of Subscriber user type are Tue and WED. 
> same observation for men where the number of men Subscriber user type is greater than the number of men of Customer user type.
> The peak days for men of Customer user type are in SAT and FRI and for men of Subscriber user type are Tue and WED. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on Age, Gender, user Type, Duration of rounds in minutes. I Eliminated anomalous values in age and time duration helps to read the data correctly, more clearly. In the univariate exploration section, we can see that the majority of biker are aged between 20 - 40 and the average number of minutes that cyclists drive is 10 minutes. In the Bivariate exploration section by using a heatmap we can see that the riders between the ages of 25-40 are ride the longest times compared to the rest of them. In the Multivariate exploration section, we can see that both men and women prefer to be Subscriber user type more than Customer user type and the peak day for Customers user type is SAT and the peak day for Subscriber user type is TUE.
